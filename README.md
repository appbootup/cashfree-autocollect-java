#  Cashfree Java AutoCollect Integration 

Python bindings for interacting with the Cashfree API for AutoCollect. This is useful for merchants who are looking to automatically reconcile their incoming bank transfers. 

# Using 

As you can see there are two files. "execute.java" is a guide to calling the API. <br />
NOTE : Ensure that "execute.java" and "cfAutoCollect.java" are in the same project.

# Setting Up

You will need to authenticate client by calling the client_auth function in your main as follows : 

```java
        cfAutoCollect userExample = new cfAutoCollect("dummyClientId", "dummyClientSecret", "TEST/PROD");
        userExample.client_auth();
```

# Functionality

You can perform the following functions : 

**Create Virtual Account**
```
        userExample.create_virtual_account("TEST","Tester", "9999999999", "tester@gmail.com");
```

**View Recent Payments according to Virtual Account ID**
```
        userExample.recent_payments("TEST");
```
**List all Virtual Accounts**

```
        userExample.list_all_va();
```
